Due Dates:  Saturday, November 1 at 11:59pm 

Submit:    eLearning

Late Policy:  -10 points per hour late

Instructions: This is an individual assignment.  All work should be your own.



Objective:

     Work with hashing by creating a hash map using linear probing.


Description:

     Create a generic class called LinearProbingHashMap<K,V>.

     It should contain a private static class, Entry<K,V>.

     Because Java cannot create an array of a generic class, create the
     array for the table like this:  

       Entry<K,V> table[];      // declare generic
       table = new Entry[size]; // create as non-generic

     This will generate a warning but will otherwise work.
 

     Your class should have the following methods.  The methods should 
     all operate on the object making the call (none are static).  

     Perform checking of the parameters and throw exceptions where 
     appropriate.

   20 points
   a) public void insert(K key, V value)
         inserts entry, rehashes if half full,
         can re-use deleted entries, throws
         exception if key is null

   20 points
   b) public V find(K key)
          returns value for key, or null if not found,
          throws exception if key is null

   20 points
   c) public boolean delete(K key)
          marks the entry deleted but leaves it there,
          returns true if deleted, false if not found,
          throws exception if key is null

   20 points
   d) private void rehash( )
          doubles the table size, hashes everything to
          the new table, omitting items marked deleted

   20 points
   e) public static void main(String args[])
          demonstrate each of your methods
